# Teams Proactive Message

I built this project because I couldn't find a simple example of how to send proactive messages to users/channels in Microsoft Teams. Every example either started with a user sending a message to my bot (and thus had pre-existing Teams context), or had a ton of other functionality wrapped around the proactive message. This project is meant to be the most basic implementation of proactive messages. This project is not production-ready nor a representation of how you should do this for reals.
